# Chapter Three: The Lazy Controller

## Rohan
* Everything in this chapter makes a lot of sense to me in general.

* Interesting distinction between ego depletion (less willing to exert effort on consecutive tasks) and cognitive busyness (inability to do so rather than just lack of motivation). Question to think about: what are examples of each of these from your own life? Can you generalize the qualitative differences between the kinds of experiences that led to each?

* Although, it seems that there is a lot of gray area between ego depletion and cognitive busyness. I could see both being major contributors to someone not performing a task.
