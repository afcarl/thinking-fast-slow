# Chapter One: The Characters of the Story

## Smitha 
**Name whether each task is done by System 1 or System 2.**

* Make a "disgust face" when shown a horrible picture
* Check the validity of a complex logical argument
* Drive a car on an empty road
* Fill out a tax form
* Detect hostility in a voice
* Answer 2 + 2 = ?
* Park in a narrow space
* Detect that one object is more distant than another
* Look for a woman with white hair
* Count the occurences of the letter a in a page of text
* Maintain a faster walking speed than is natural for you
* Orient to the source of a sudden sound
* Understand simple sentences
* Tell someone your phone number
* Recognize that "a meek and tidy soul with a passion for detail" resembles an
  occupational stereotype
* Read words on large bill-boards
* Search memory to identify a surprising sound
* Complete the phrase "bread and.."
* Focus on the voice of a particular person in a crowded and noisy room
* Focus attention on the clowns at a circus
* Monitor the appropriateness of your behavior in a social situation
* Compare two washing machines for overall value
* Brace for the starter gun in a race

**Answers**: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,

**Question** Kahneman gives an example of how one of his psychotherapy teachers told the
class to stay away from charming patients with a history of failed treatments
because they were likely to be psychopaths.  What are examples of ways in which
you allowed System 1 thinking to blind you from clear warning signs about a
person?  Or examples of the opposite where System 1 thinking made you
suspicious about a person for no good reason?

## Jason
People react with System 1 but follow up with System 2.

* Things that are System 1:
	* sympathy
	* panic

* Things that are System 2:
	* conscious thought
	* analytical thinking
	* problem solving
	
* How can we exploit System 1?
	* cannot be turned off
	* we don't recognize them in ourselves
	* prejudice, confirmation bias, conformity 
	* force quick decisions

* How can we exploit System 2?
	* requires mental exertion
		* mental resources not always adequate when making decisions
			* ie driving and talking
			* overwhelm the mind to force rash decisions [information overload]
			* never make a big decision on the spot
	* salesman/lawyer tactics
		* tons of confusing terms
		* changing the topic constantly


## Rohan
Interesting point from introduction: when faced with the need to employ intuitive heuristics for a difficult question, we sometimes answer an easier one without even noticing the shift. What are examples of this? (Example: people typically want to know "Is voting for this candidate the best decision for the future of America?" but this gets transformed to "How much do I like this candidate?")

**My Observations/Interesting Questions**

* Does System 2 really overpower/overrule System 1 in some cases, as Kahneman says? Or is it more of *convincing* your System 1 that the logically based decision is the way to go? It seems like we don't really make purely logical decisions without first convincing our emotional side that this is the way to go. Otherwise, we tend to get stuck in a battle of rational thinking versus emotions.

* It's good to keep in mind that System 1 is different per person. For example, I did not think automatically of "butter" in the text completion exercise "bread and..."

* Does System 2 get the last word as stated by Kahneman? I feel like base emotions ultimately drive us to act in whatever way we do, using logic simply as a strong heuristic for governing behavior. Maybe I'm misinterpreting and he just means to say that when System 1 can't do something (like 23 times 87), System 2 takes over and gets to govern behavior -- I then completely agree.

* Cognitive illusion: allows for classification based on percepts like underlying characteristics of an object. What distinguishes this from something like a more tangible illusion? I think my definition is inadequate.

* How can we binarize our mental thought into these two systems? It seems like there's much more going on, possibly with respect to a higher level controller dictating what happens, or maybe just an interfacing mechanism that handles communication between the systems and is also a large influence in our mental processes.
